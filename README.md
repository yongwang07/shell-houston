# Technical Screen - Senior Fullstack Engineer (Houston)

Hello and congratulations on passing the initial phone screen! For the next stage of your application, your goal is to build a simple React application using Redux. We've created a project skeleton and have identified [an open API](https://picsum.photos) to help get you started. We've also recorded [a simple demo](https://streamable.com/fkebp) of what the finished product _should_ look like. Feel free to use any libraries to complete the challenge. Best of luck!

## Requirements

- Exercise should take between 1-2 hours
- App component should fit to the screen (no vertical/horizontal scrolling)
- `<ImageList />` should display 30 images from the API using the Redux store
- Left section (`<ImageList />`) should be scrollable
- Clicking on an image should select and display it on the right side (`<ImageDetail />`)
- Clear button should clear the image selection
- Finished project should be published within a private GitHub repo where the user [shell-houston](https://github.com/shell-houston) is set as a collaborator. _You may create a throwaway GitHub account if you don't feel comfortable sharing your personal one._

## Notes

- We value creativity and clean, well-structured code
- Feel free to optimize or improve any aspects of the application for additional brownie points
- Meaningful git commits are highly appreciated, but not required
